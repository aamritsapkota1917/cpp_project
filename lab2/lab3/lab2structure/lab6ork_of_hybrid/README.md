Theory
Inheritance
Process of creating new class from one or more existing class, the properties of existing class is extended to new class, the new class is called derived class and existing class is called base class.

Types of Inheritance

•Multiple

•Multi-level

•Hierarchical

•Hybrid

•Multipath

Ambiguity
In OOP ambiguity means duplication of members due to inheritance, In child class there will be 2 or more member with same name from inherited class.

Virtual Base Class
To avoid ambiguity we can make the common base class as virtual base classContainerClass: Class consists of object of one class in another object.
